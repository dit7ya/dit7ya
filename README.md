```
My daily affairs are quite ordinary; but I'm in total harmony with them.
I don't hold on to anything, don't reject anything; nowhere an obstacle or conflict.
Who cares about wealth and honor? Even the poorest thing shines.
My miraculous power and spiritual activity: drawing water and carrying wood.
